# A-Eberle

This plugin adds support for the A-Eberle PQI-DA smart energy meter connected via Modbus RTU.

# Setup instructions
First, set up a Modbus RTU resource using the configured settings of your meter. Once
that's set up, the PQI-DA smart can be set up like any other thing. During discovery, nymea will
offer the configured Modbus resources as possible connections. Select the one that
you've set up previously.
