# DvModbusIR read adapter

This plugin adds support to read values from smartmeterproducers and smartmeterconsumers via the DvModbusIR read adapter from Device GmbH.

## Support
This plugin was tested via two adapters **DvModbusIR 1.0** connected to bidirectional meters  
DZG DVS7612.2 and Itron 3.HZ-AC-H4-A1  
to read the values for total energy consumed and produced.

The plugin works independently from the connected meters.

## Setup and Configuration
To setup the the plugin, simply input the *modbus address* which is shown on the device.

The default configuration of the DvModbusIR adapters should not be changed.
